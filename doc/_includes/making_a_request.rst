Make a request::

    >>> server.request('add', 2, 3)
    5

The first argument to ``request`` is the *method*; everything else is passed as
*params*. Keyword arguments are also acceptable::

    >>> server.request('find', name='Foo', age=42)
    --> {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "find", "params": {"name": "Foo", "age": 42}, "id": 1}
    <-- {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": "Bar", "id": 1}
    Bar

.. tip::

    To see the underlying JSON messages going back and forth, see the Logging_
    section below.

If you don't need any data returned, use ``notify`` instead of ``request``::

    >>> server.notify('go')

Alternate usage
---------------

If you prefer, there's another way to make a request::

    >>> server.add(2, 3, response=True)
    5

That's the same as saying ``server.request('add', 2, 3)``. With this usage, pass
``response=True`` to get a response; without that it's a notification.
